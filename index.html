    <h1>The Interesting Life of Ernest Ustian</h1>
    <h2>
      My name is Ernest Ustian. I go to school at
      <a href="https://www.siths.org/">Staten Island Technical Highschool </a>
    </h2>
    I really like SITHS but getting here is a pain. I first have to
    <ol>
      <li>Wake up at 6:AM (now who is trying to do that)</li>

      <li>Get on a bus by MAX 7:25 AM</li>

      <li>Survive the 4 billion kids that somehow all fit in the bus</li>

      <li>
        And then finally leave the bus and be able to have some moving space
        while getting to school
      </li>
    </ol>
    Outside of school I have some hobbies. I like
    <ul>
      <li>
        Going to the gym
